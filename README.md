# Handmade LSTM

A LSTM implementation with only using basic components of pytorch. The goal of this project
is to offer clean code that is easy to inspect and extend while retaining
competitive performance. Arguably, it offers the most clean code that
you can find if you are trying to know how LSTM works. Chapter 4 of [Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf) is recommneded for theoretical background.

# demo
Please see [demon](demo.ipynb) to see how to use it.
